I am seeking a full-time position as a software developer or a database administrator.  My interests are in robotics, virtual/augmented reality, human-computer interaction, and accessibility.  I am very excited to start building technology that will shape our future and change the world.  I believe that by integrating virtual and augmented reality with robotics, we can solve many accessibility problems.</p>

                            Giving in class quizzes can be difficult and the difficulty only increases as class size increases.  Not only does it take time for teachers to manually grade all their students quizzes, but it leaves students in the dark about where they stand in class.  QuizO is an interactive web application that allows teachers to easily offer in class quizzes to students that provides immediate feedback. <br>  <br>

                            QuizO is a web application that allows teachers to give their students quiz from their web browser.  QuizO uses Django and a MySQL database.  There are two different types of users - a host and a student.  The host can able to create quizzes that multiple students can join via a unique ID number.  Each participant can optionally be aliased with a nickname of their choice.  Each player will be showed their answer after each question and given a total score after the quiz is completed.

                            Our goal was to make Sparki reposses hot wheel cars.  We were able to control Sparki by using 6 different hand gestures.  We wrote computer vision algorithm in Python using OpenCV that was able to count the number of fingers.  The 6 gestures corresponded to the following movements: stop, move forward, turn left, turn right, close gripper, and open gripper.  These 6 gestures allowed us to control Sparki to repossess cars.

                            <br><br>

                            To make the hand recognition algorithm, we used OpenCV in Python.  After we would read in the raw image, we would "mask" the image.  This turned the image into a binary version of the image so it just appeared in two colors - black or white.  After that, we were able to call the built in OpenCV functions "FindContours", "convexHull" and "convexityDefects" to help us calculate how many fingers were in the image.  The function that calculates the number of fingrs returns an integer.  This integer gets passed to our C code on Sparki as a byte over the serial.  This byte corresponds to a Sparki movement.

                            Skin cancer is one of the most popular types of cancer, but it can be cured if it is caught early enough.  Unfortunately, the human eye is not good at detecting skin cancer.  Because of this, there are many unnecessary biopsies performed every year.  By creating a neural network that learns to identify skin cancer, A.I. Dermatologist can help reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies performed each year while increasing the number of skin cancer cases caught.

                            <br> <br>

                            A.I. Dermatologist utilizes the <a href = "https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main">ISIC dataset</a> of over 22,000 images to train a neural network to identify skin cancer.  To expand the dataset, we augmented each image.  Each image was augmented three ways: flipped over the y-axis, rotated 90 degrees, and rotated 180 degrees.  Using OpenCV, the skin lesion was able to be identified in each image.  All the images were stored in different buckets on Amazon Web Services.  The use of AWS buckets allowed us to split the data up 34% training/66% testing.  The images were ran through a neural network that would classify a skin lesion as benign or malignant.

                            In Guardians of the Galaxy, Yondu is able to control his red arrow with his mind.  Whistler is an Occulus game that allows the user to step into Yondu's shoes and kill enemies with their own arrow.  Each enemy randomly spawns in the scene and progressively moves closer to the user.  The arrow follows the users gaze and the user can either send the arrow away or bring it closer by using the left and right trigger of the occulus.  The game was created in Unity.  When the arrow collides with an enemy, a particle effect is applied to the enemy and it will explode into small cubes.

                            Every second approximately 6,000 tweets are tweeted.  Many users tweet about current events, companies, and their personal lives.  ClutterSight is a web appication that allows a company or person to search for a keyword and ClutterSight searches all recent tweets for that keyword.  Then, ClutterSight categorizes each tweet as either "positive", "negative", or "neutral".  This data is displayed via a pie chart showing the user the percentage breakdown of the tweets.

                            <br> <br>

                            Each tweet was read in using Apache Storm.  This allowed the tweets to be categorized in real-time.  Each tweet was ran through a machine learning algorithm that assigned each tweet a sentiment and then stored the tweet and sentiment in a MySQL database.  The tweets were pulled from the database though a PHP script and updated the pie chart as new tweets came in or when the search criteria changed.

                            There is nothing more frustraing then when you pick up a friend only for them to text you "give me 10 minutes" when you finally arrive.  To avoid the frustration, it is always temping to send them the "here" message when you are still a few minutes out.  Although everyone thinks that they will be fine to look down at their phone for 10 seconds to send the text message, the reality is that any distraction on the road could cause an accident.  ETHey eliminates the need to text and drive by automatically sending messages for users while they are driving. <br> <br>

                            ETHey utilizes your phones GPS services to track your location as you drive.  You tell ETHey your destination, who you want to alert, and when.  ETHey will send messages based off of your location or your time of arrival - it's your choice!  ETHey also lets you set the message before you begin driving to eliminate any distractions behind the wheel.  If you are picking up multiple people, ETHey can help with that too.  Simply enter your route and ETHey will tell the next person when you are on the way.  ETHey was developed as an iOS Application using Swift and a MySQL database.
