			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>This is a two button switch program.  I chose the "P" and "Q" keys to control the application because they are far away from each other on the keyboard, so the user will not accidentally push the wrong button.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Instructions for using the app:</b> "P" key to select an item, "Q" key to go to the next item</li>
				<li><b>Test: </b> To test interacting with my app, test will be ran with one hand versus two hands.  To test the system, users will input the following equations, and then clear the screen after getting the result of the equation: <br>
				<b>**Note </b> that I stopped timing the trial after hitting the equals button and getting the result.
				<br>
				(1) 7 + 3 - 5 * 3= <br>
				(2) 4 * 13 / 2 = <br>
				(3) 900 - 467 * 2= <br>
				(4) 5 - 8 * 3 = <br>
				(5) 6 * 8 + 9= <br>
				(6) 71 - 4 / 3 = <br>

					<b>Common Errors & Conclusions: </b>When I was using two hands, I was able to go fairly quickly because I did not have to move my hands from the position they were in, all I had to do was to was remember which hand moved the selection box and which hand would select the box.  Due to the faster speed of being able to use two hands, I often missed the button I was aiming for an had to go through all the buttons again to reach the button I needed.  This happened multiple times during the one hand and two hand trials, slowing down my time a bit.  An error that often occured during my one hand trials was that I would miss the key that I meant to press.  My initial design for the swtich buttons was to use the space bar as the "select" key, but while testing my webpage I found that sometimes when I would hit the space bar the page would scroll down instead of selecting the button.  I changed to pushing "P" and "Q" instead.  I originally chose "P" and "Q" because they are very far apart on the keyboard, so if a user accidentally presses a key around the desired key it would not affect the webpage.  However, after testing it with one hand, it was hard for me to go back and forth on the keyboard to interact with my webpage.  Although a two-button switch interface can be very simple to learn how to control, I do not think that it is the most effective.  I would have liked to add a third button that would allow me to go backwards on the page.  This would have helped decrease the time that it took me to perform the tests because if I missed the target button I would be able to go back and select it instead of having to go through all of the buttons again.  Overall, a two-button switch interface is a lot easier to use with two hands when the two buttons are far apart on the keyboard.  The average time for one-hand test cases is almost double the two-hand tests for almost all of the equations.  OVerall, errors occurred with both the one-hand and two-hand tests.  I did not explicitly record the number of errors for each run, but there were very few times that I had a "clean run" at the test.  On almost every test I missed the button I was aiming to hit and had to filter through all of the buttons to get back to the one I wanted.

				<li><b>Anything else you have tried out:</b> I had originally had the "space" bar as the selection button.  However, when testing it out I found that if the calculator was not selected, the page would scroll down.  I changed that selection control from the space bar to the "P" key instead.</li>
