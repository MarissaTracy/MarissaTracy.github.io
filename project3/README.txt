    CSCI 4849 - Input Interaction & Accessibility

Description:
    This is an accessible HTML & Javascript game with simple controls and a simple purpose. You can control the basket at the bottom
    of the screen either with your mouse/track pad or with the keys P and Q. The basket's color is randomized every time the screen is
    loaded and can only move along the bottom of the screen left and right. Colored balls will fall from the top of the screen, the 
    locations and colors are randomized. The goal of the game is to catch the balls that match the color of the basket before they hit
    the bottom of the screen. If you catch the wrong color of ball, your score will go down. If you catch the correct color of ball, 
    your score will go up. Directions on the controls, the score, and the number of remaining lives are listed in the upper lefthand
    corner of the game screen. 

Instructions on playing the game:
    Go to marissatracy.github.io/project3/p3.html OR storykiser.github.io/csci4849/project3/p3.html to play the live version on Github.
    Alternatively, download all the files into the same directory and then open the p3.html file in a browser. Both methods work exactly
    the same. Once the game loads in your browser, it will start immediately so be prepared to begin looking at the balls falling at the
    top of the screen. The game should work in any browser, but it does not currently have a mobile adaptation. There are no special
    requirements, all you need is a desktop browser and either the links above or the files in a directory on your computer.
